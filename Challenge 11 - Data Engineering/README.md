# Challenge 11 - Data Engineering


Complete data engineering workflow: design database schema, load CSV data into MySQL, and run analytical queries. 

# Note:
Python script provides flexible CSV import without moving files or changing MySQL security settings, unlike SQL's LOAD DATA INFILE which requires specific upload directories.
